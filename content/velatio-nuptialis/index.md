# About 

The _velatio nuptialis_, or nuptial veil, is an ancient wedding custom. It may also be called a care cloth or wedding canopy. Like all wedding customs and texts, it has a complicated and rich history. 

In practice, it's quite simple: during the Nuptial Blessing, a cloth is held over the heads of the bride and groom. 

Below is a collection of photos and histories of this beautiful custom.
