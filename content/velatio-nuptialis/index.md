# About 

The _velatio nuptialis_ is an ancient wedding custom, sometimes called the care cloth or nuptial veil. Like all wedding customs and texts, it has a complicated and rich history. In practice, it's quite simple: during the Nuptial Blessing, a cloth is held over the heads of the bride and groom. 

Below is a collection of photos and histories of this beautiful custom.
