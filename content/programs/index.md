# About 

Wedding programs can be an excellent way to familiarize, or at least introduce, your wedding Mass guests to the unique rites and traditions of a Latin Mass wedding. Programs can include any combination of information on: the wedding party, the couple's story, reception details, Mass texts, music, responses, and more. If you would like help creating a wedding program for a Latin Mass wedding, [contact me](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/#contact) for a quote!
