From our wedding: bridal veil; bridal crown; hair pins shaped like rue leaves, a bridal custom from Lithuania

# About

Local wedding customs are difficult to describe. For one, by their nature they’re usually passed on orally, not in writing. For another, an unfortunate consequence of the Council of Trent was a widespread loss of local customs in favor of uniformity with Rome. Combined with a dramatic rise in homogenous global customs, local wedding customs can be hard to come by.

What I have found on this topic is scattershot, and varying in verifiability.

I have arranged the customs thematically, and will add examples of each custom as I find them in newspapers, literature, and stories.

If you are interested in researching more about local customs, try historical archives and online newspaper collections - or ask your family.

# Crowns/wreaths

> Norway: "The youth’s head is bare; the bride wears her marriage crown as proudly as any queen."

“**Philadelphia Letter**.” _The Catholic Telegraph_, July 6, 1876. https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/?a=d&d=TCT18760706-01.1.1&srpos=7.

# Veils

Veiling could refer to two things: the veil worn by the bride, or the pall, or cloth, raised over the couple's hands or heads.

# Rings

> America: "The new tabernacle curtain at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church runs on golden wedding rings. The curtain and the wedding-ring idea were copied after the curtain in the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament in Westminster Cathedral, London, at the suggestion of the pastor, the Rev. Henry van Boxel. Wedding rings which in some families had been handed down from generation to generation and the wedding rings of widows were given for this Louisiana church."

> "In Christian tradition the wedding ring was not highly ornamented; the important thing was rather that it be of pure, unalloyed metal, symbolizing true marriage, the Rev. Dr. Edgar Schmiedeler, O.S.B.. Director of the Family Life Bureau of the National Catholic Welfare Conference, declared on the Faith in Our Time program."

“*Elaborate Wedding Rings Are Not in Christian Tradition, Speaker Says*.” _Catholic News Service_, April 25, 1949. https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/?a=d&d=cns19490425-01.1.11&srpos=2.

# Flowers

Slovenia's national flower is a carnation, and one of their wedding customs involves carnations, and an unveiling at midnight.

> South Philadelphia, America: "In a display that has remained a unique feature of South Philly culture, the groom is expected to “surprise” his bride at some point before the wedding (often the day before) by singing to her from the street."

> At one lime the marriage custom of York, Eng., required that the bride throw herself at the feel of her husband if he gave her land as part of the dowry. And many dioceses in France had the couple lie prone before the altar with a pall held over them during the nuptial blessing. These rites may seem peculiar, but modern day marriage customs had their origins centuries ago in practices equally strange to us.
