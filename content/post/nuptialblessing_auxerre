One of the most common questions regarding Latin Mass weddings is, "Do you include the Gloria and/or the Creed?" 

# The short answer 

For the votive mass _Missa pro Sponso et Sponsa_, the Gloria is included and the Creed is not included.

# The long answer

Rubrics in recent memory have been consistent that the Creed is not said for the votive wedding Mass. The Creed has traditionally been understood as a part of the Mass exclusive to Sundays, and important feasts. 

As for the Gloria, before 1960, the rubrics as per the Roman Missal, and every commentary I have found, was to omit the Gloria from the _Missa pro sponso_. 

The rubrical revisions in 1960 and the subsequent 1962 Roman Missal allowed for the Gloria to be said for the _Missa pro sponso_. 

Occasionally, Catholic newspaper articles reported wedding Masses that included the Gloria, such as [the wedding Mass of the daughter of General William Tecumseh Sherman](https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/?a=d&d=TCT18741008-01.1.5&srpos=12). This is not terribly surprising, given (for better or for worse) long-standing divergences between wedding rules and practice.

The bigger complicating factor for this ostensibly simple history is that the entry for wedding Masses in _The Catholic Encyclopedia_ - fully available online and easily accessible - is rubrically out of date on this point. That entry is from 1911, and the rubrics in force for the Traditional Latin Mass are the _General Rubrics of the Roman Missal_, 1960. 

Below is a sample of sources, arranged chronologically. They can be considered in two tiers: of primary importance (the Roman Missal and its supplements), secondary importance (rubrical commentaries), and tertiary importance (one newspaper article).

> f) the Mass _pro sponso et sponsa is considered a _Missa votiva privata_, even if a simple _Missa cantata_ or solemn High Mass; hence there is no _Gloria_ nor _Credo_...

> With regard to the insertion of the Gloria into the Roman Mass liturgy, we have only obscure and uncertain accounts. The use of the Gloria was originally and for a long period rather restricted: it served by preference for the expression of Christmas joy and the Easter chant of exultation. Until nearly the close of the eleventh century the rubrics of the Gregorian Sacramentary prevailed, which granted or prescribed the recitation of the Gloria by the bishop on all Sundays and feast-days; by the priest, on the contrary, only at Easter. But from that time this privilege of the bishops was extended also to priests. Since the revision of the Missal under Pope Pius V. (t 1572) the following rule holds good: as often as the Te Deum occurs in the Matins of the Office, the Gloria is said in the Mass corresponding to the Office; but if the Ambrosian Hymn is omitted in the Office, then in the Mass of the day the Angels Hymn is not to be recited.

> [The Creed] occurs in the latter liturgy only on certain days as a mark of special distinction.

(In the pages that follow, Gihr does not include the _Missa pro sponso_ as one of the masses that merits the Credo.)

> If NUPTIAL MASS is to follow, the priest vests and Mass begins. The nuptial Mass is the votive Mass “Pro sponso et sponsa,” in the missal. It is said with white vestments, without _Gloria in excelsis_ or creed.

> Si solemnis benedictio Nuptiarum, intra Missam, facienda sit die Dominica, vel alio die Festo, sive de praecepto, licet suppresso, sive Duplici I vel II classis, aut in Octavis Epiphaniae, Paschatis, Pentecostes aut Corporis Christi, vel in Feriis ac vigiliis privilegiatis, dicatur Missa de officio occurrenti, cum Gloria in excelsis et Credo, si illa Missa id requirat, et cum Commemoratione sequentis Missae pro Sponso et Sponsa, et reliquis quae pro Communione et complemento benedictionis in ea habentur. Si autem solemnis benedictio Nuptiarum, intra Missam, facienda sit aliis diebus, etiamsi in iis occurrat Festum Duplex majus vel minus, dicatur sequens Missa votiva pro Sponso et Sponsa, praeterquam in Commemoratione Omnium Fidelium Defunctorum, in qua et Missa votica et solemnis benedictio Nuptialis prohibentur. 

(The Roman Missal itself may be a source of confusion, especially for beginners like myself. The rubrics do say "cum Gloria...et Credo," but they are not actually referring to the nuptial Mass. They refer to occasions in which the nuptial Mass is superceded by a greater feast.

> The Mass _pro sponsis_, though specially privileged with regard to the days on which it may be celebrated, has the rank of a private votive Mass (p. 141). Hence, the _Gloria_ and Creed are omitted...

> 325. Votive Masses are of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th class. The classes are considered individually in the following sections. (...)

> 341. By a votive Mass of the 2nd class is meant a votive Mass which may be celebrated on all liturgical days of the 2nd , 3rd and 4th class. The Mass for bride and bridegroom and the Mass of thanksgiving on the 25th or 50th wedding anniversary are prohibited, however, on all Sundays.

> 342. Votive Masses of the 2nd class, provided for by the general rubrics, are: [...] j) The votive Mass "for Bride and Bridegroom" and the Mass of thanksgiving on the 25th and 50th wedding anniversary (nos. 378-382).

> 343. The privileges of votive Masses of the 2nd class are: a) they are said Gloria, unless violet vestments are used; but without creed, unless it is said by 
reason of an occurring Sunday or octave…

(This is when the rubrics were changed from no Gloria to yes Gloria.)

> Si solemnis benedictio nuptiarum, intra Missam, facienda sit die dominico vel die I classis, dicitur Missa de Officio occurrente, cum commemoratione sequentis Missae pro sponsis, sub unica conclusione, etiam diebus in quibus commemoratio Missae votivae impeditae prohibetur; et in ea datur benedictio nuptialis more solito. Si autem solemnis benedictio nuptiarum, intra Missam, facienda sit aliis diebus, dicitur sequens Missa votiva pro sponsis. In Commemoratione omnium Fidelium defunctorum et Triduo sacro prohibetur sive Missa votiva, sive eius commemoratio in Missa diei, sive benedictio nuptialis. infra Missam. Cum vero tam Missa pro sponsis quam benedictio nuptialis prohibetur, Missa una cum benedictione transferri potest in opportuniorem diem non impeditum, post celebratum matrimonium.

These nuptial rubrics are largely the same as the 1942 Roman Missal.
