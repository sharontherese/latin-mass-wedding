The blessing below is taken from the 1954 _Collectio Rituum ad instar appendicis Rituali Romani pro dioecesibus statuum foederatorum Americae septentrionalis_. This blessing is intended for couples marrying with the traditional Rite of Marriage, without a wedding Mass. 

After the exchange of rings, the priest reads Psalm 127, and then says a short prayer. 

# Latin

## Psalmus 127

Beatus, quicumque times Dominum, qui ambulas in viis ejus! 

Nam laborem manuum tuarum manducabis, beatus eris et bene tibi erit. 

Uxor tua sicut vitis fructifera in penetralibus domus tuae, 

Filii tui ut surculi olivarum circa mensam tuam. 

Ecce sic benedictur vir, qui timet Dominum! 

Benedicat tibi Dominus ex Sion, ut videas prosperitatem Jerusalem onmibus diebus vitae tuae. 

Ut videas filios filiorum tuorum: pas super Israel! 

Gloria patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto. Sicut erit in principio, et nunc, et semper, et in saecula saeculorum. Amen. 

## Blessing

_Si nuptie non sint benedicenda, post Psalmum 127 cum Versiculis, ut supra n. 7, Sacerdos dicat sequentem tantum orationem:_

Oremus. Praetende, quaesumus, Domine, fidelibus tuis dexteram caelestis auxilii, ut te toto corde perquirant, et quae digne postulant assequantur. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. 

R. Amen.

## Psalm 127

Happy are you who fear the Lord, who walk in his ways!

For you shall eat the fruit of your handiwork; happy shall you be, and favored. 

Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine in the recesses of your home; 

Your children like olive plants around your table. 

Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears the Lord. 

The Lord bless you from Sion: May you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life; 

May you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel! 

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

## Blessing

Let us pray. O Lord, we implore Thee, extend to Thy faithful servants the right hand of Thy divine assistance, so that they may seek Thee with their whole hearts and receive from Thee whatever they ask for that is right. Through Christ our Lord. 

R. Amen.
