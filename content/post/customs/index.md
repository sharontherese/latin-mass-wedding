One of the questions foremost in the minds of Catholic couples is what wedding customs are actually traditional, and what are (dare I say) accretions? 

Wedding customs and rituals, highly regionalized, as unregulated by Rome as possible, are a tricky animal. It’s the usual conundrum: if tradition is what came before, and we’ve had several consecutive generations deviate from the tradition, what’s more traditional? Doing what your parents did, or doing what 5 generations back did? 

We shall leave a full exploration of such questions to keyboard amateur liturgists. Instead, I’d like to share nine Roman Catholic wedding customs throughout history - and one custom that is not traditional. 

# 1. Betrothal

Betrothals have surged in popularity lately, and are a delightful custom with a rich history[^1]. The rite is not universally standardized, and fairly simple in its requirements. The engaged couple meets with their priest and some witnesses in a church, the priest blesses their engagement, and some readings are read.

# 2. Veni Creator 

The Missa pro Sponso (introit: Deus Israel conjugavit) was set down as the votive Mass for weddings by the Council of Trent. Before Trent, it was common to have slight variations in the readings, depending on what part of Christendom you were in. For example, medieval England sometimes used the Mass of the Holy Trinity for wedding Masses. In the same vein, some regions[^2] sang the Veni Creator during the wedding rites. One of the oldest and most beloved hymns, made more famous by the Carmelites of Compeigne singing when they went to their execution, there is a lifetime’s worth of meditation material when thinking about the Holy Ghost and marriage. The names and virtues of the Holy Ghost - peace, love, understanding, refining fire, the Comforter - could not be more fitting for marriage. Read Father Vincent McNabb’s beautiful meditation here[^3]. 

# 3. Exhortation

If you flip through older ritual books and prayer books, you may see a marriage exhortation, read by the priest to the couple. As with many wedding customs, it’s a variable custom, but generally it takes place right after the couple enters the church, and right before the Rite of Marriage starts. 

# 4. Hand fasting

If you want to put the Roman in Roman Catholic, look closely at the rubrics in the Rite of Marriage. You’ll see a direction to the priest, for him to wrap his stole around the couple’s left hands. This custom, also called hand-fasting, can be traced back at least to Ancient Rome.[^4]

# 5. Nuptial Preface

In 2020, the Vatican approved of seven ‘new’ prefaces for use in the Latin Mass. One preface, the _Praefatio de Nuptiis_, is for wedding Masses, and is quite old indeed.[^5]

Although its use is optional, a nuptial preface is particularly fitting, if one reads Father Nicholas Gihr’s description of the Preface:

> Holy Scripture informs us that Jesus Christ “gave thanks” to His Heavenly Father before consecrating the bread and wine, that is, before He changed them into His Body and Blood. Who could fail to understand, even at the first glance, that the Church too herein follows the example of her Divine Lord and Master, from the fact that at the Eucharistic Celebration she places before the act of Consecration the Preface, an incomparably elevated chant of praise and thanksgiving to God? [...] According to their text and melody the Prefaces belong to the most solemn, sublime and touching chants of the Church; they are the purest poetry, flowing from the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. The Church is the divinely enlightened proclaimer of the Eternal, **she is the Bride of Christ ever in communication with Him, and this communication is a never-ending nuptial celebration in sacrifice and prayer**: therefore, speech becomes on her lips a poem, a canticle, having throughout a poetical feature.[^6] (emphasis added)

# 6. Nuptial veil

The nuptial veil, or _velatio nuptialis_, is enjoying something of a renaissance in Catholic weddings lately[^7]. Visually striking, it evokes ancient Jewish customs, Eucharistic processions, and royalty. 

# 7. Flowers

Flowers are one of the most colorful and customizable parts of a wedding day. Every flower comes with a rich history, symbolism, and an array of rubrics and etiquette. Many brides choose to present a bouquet to Mary, after Communion. While not in the official ceremonies, the practice may go back at least several centuries[^8]. Anecdotally, this author can report that a few couples have expanded the practice to include Saint Joseph as well. Mary and Joseph are connected to a vast bouquet of flowers[^9], and depending on the source and handling of the flowers, wedding day flowers can be incorporated into a Mary Garden[^10].

# 8. Blessing of the bedroom

Most wedding customs spring up from the murky historical past, and are encouraged or tolerated as additional adornments to the official ceremonies. The blessing of the bedroom, _benedictio thalami_, can claim the rare privilege of being in the Rituale Romanum[^11]. It is probable that this blessing was more common when weddings took place at home. 

# 9: Unity Candle

Most researchers agree that wedding unity candles did not come into practice before the mid-to-late twentieth century; Father Kenneth Doyle at the Catholic News Service[^12] wondered if the custom came from the soap opera General Hospital.
