> Engagements may be made formal espousals by putting the promise to marry in writing, signed by the parties and the parish priest of the bride or of the place where the contract was made (or before the local ordinary), and before two witnesses. This is not binding in law. It is not generally a practice in the United States.

> **The betrothal rite.** In earlier times, when a man and woman became engaged, they solemnized their agreement in the church by plighting their troth. This ceremony is enjoying a remarkable revival in the United States. 
> 
> The ceremony is simple and short. You and your spouse-to-be promise before a priest that you will prepare yourselves in the best way possible for the sacred state of matrimony. You assert solemnly that you sincerely intend to wed unless you discover defects that would make marriage undesirable. 
> 
> This ceremony symbolizes your desire to spend your days before your wedding in trying to make sure that you're doing the right thing. It doesn't bind you to marry. Rather, it emphasizes the importance of thorough preparation for marriage and it imbues bride and bridegroom with a sense of the important spiritual nature of the marriage contract. 
> 
> The betrothal rite will give you a greater sense of the dignity and idealism of married life. It will dispose you to treat it with the reverence it deserves.

> pg. 327: Second, the Western tradition has learned to distinguish between betrothals and espousals, engagements and weddings. Betrothals were defined as a future promise to rnarry, to be announced publicly in the local community and to be fulfilled after a suitable waiting period. Espousals were defined as the present promise to marry, to be celebrated- in a public ceremony before civil and/or religious officials. The point of a public betrothal and waiting period was to allow couples to weigh the depth and durability of their mutual love. It was also to invite others to weigh in on the maturity and compatibility of the couple, to offer them counsel and commodities, and to prepare for the celebration of their union and their life together thereafter. Too long an engagement would encourage the couple to fornication. But too short an engagement would discourage them from introspection. Too secret and private a marriage would deprive couples of the essential counsel and gifts of their families and friends. But too public and routinized a marriage would deprive couples of the indispensable privacy and intimacy needed to tailor their nuptiais to their own preferences. Hence the traditional balance of engagement and wedding, of publicity and privacy, of waiting and consummating.

## 19th century

"An Italian Betrothal." The Catholic Telegraph, August 29 1895. https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/?a=d&d=TCT18950829-01.2.58.

> In Italy a formal betrothal is considered almost as binding and sacred as marriage itself, and a breach of promise, especially on .the girl’s side, is regarded with intense indignation. A girl who breaks her engagement is called a civetta — an owlet — possibly because owlets are used in Italy as decoys for ensnaring other birds. The epithet sticks to the girl for life and often proves fatal to her matrimonial chances.

## 1900s

"Wedding Rings." The Catholic Telegraph, August 1 1901. https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/?a=d&d=TCT19010801-01.2.16.

> In ancient times the ceremony of betrothal was really more solemn than marriage, and the betrothal ring was considered the more important of the two. The marriage ceremony was looked upon as a mere ratification of the betrothal contract. The Church very rightly then punished by excommunication any violation of the betrothal contract. It is interesting to know that the first part of our marriage service down to the “I will” is a remnant of the old betrothal service. 

"Sacredness of Betrothel." The Catholic Telegraph, December 4 1902. https://thecatholicnewsarchive.org/?a=d&d=TCT19021204-01.2.37.

> So sacred does the Catholic Church regard marriage that it does not allow either party to a betrothal to disregard the promise of marriage without a good and sufficient reason. Non-Catholics throughout the east were greatly surprised last week at the following dispatch which appeared in a number of local papers: Fall River, Mass., Nov. 24. —Miss Mary McDonald, plaintiff in the breach-of-promise-of-marriage suit against Patrick Kieran, the wealthy superintendent of the Fall River Water Works, in which she got $15,000, has released Mr. Kieran from his promise to marry her and he is at liberty now to enter into the marriage contract with another woman. Miss McDonald had blocked his effort to get married by filing a protest with Bishop Harkins, of Providence. This became public when Mr. Rieran applied to the ehurch for a dispensation to marry Miss McDonald’s rival. This request was denied. He insisted upon the dispensation and an ecclesiastical court was to have been convened this week to determine the issue. But Miss McDonald changed her mind to-day and filed with Bishop Harkins her written withdrawal of her objection to Mr. Kieran’s marriage to another.
