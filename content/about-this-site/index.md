# About Me

My husband, William, and I were married in a Latin Mass wedding on September 22, 2018. While we were both familiar with the Latin Mass, we found that we had a good deal to learn about a Latin Mass wedding. Much knowledge has been lost about nuptial services, liturgies, customs, and expectations.

As a librarian who is chronically unable to be relaxed about anything, I spent much of my wedding planning time accruing piles of research on Catholic wedding masses. This website is everything I have found, to date, about Latin Mass weddings, plus a lot of extra (but related) content on traditional aspects of Catholicism.

The critical stuff is in the [Rite of Marriage](/rite-of-marriage/) and the [Wedding Mass](/the-wedding-mass/).

Everything else, from [rubrics ](/rubrics-for-the-wedding-mass/)to [roses](/flowers/), can be found under the Planning section.

Most pages have an "About" section at the top, to provide context.

Any word in _italics_ can be found in the [Glossary](/glossary/).

I have an [FAQ ](/faqs/)page to get you started.

Also see [Latin Mass Baptism](https://latinmassbaptism.com/), the sister site to this one.

I also have a [personal site](https://sharonkabel.com) full of fun and exciting research.
