# About Me

My husband and I were married in a Latin Mass wedding in 2018. While we were both very familiar with the Latin Mass, we found that we had a good deal to learn about a Latin Mass wedding. Much knowledge has been lost about nuptial services, liturgies, customs, and expectations.

As a librarian who is chronically unable to be relaxed about anything, I spent much of my wedding planning time accruing piles of research. This website is everything I have found to date.

The texts of the ceremonies are in the [Rite of Marriage](/rite-of-marriage/) and the [Wedding Mass](/the-wedding-mass/).

Everything else, from [rubrics ](/rubrics-for-the-wedding-mass/)to [roses](/flowers/), can be found under the Planning section.

Most pages have an "About" section at the top, to provide context.

I have an [FAQ ](/faqs/) and a [Glossary](/glossary/) to get you started.

I also have a [personal site](https://sharonkabel.com) full of fun and exciting research.
