_Blessing of a bedchamber, by Bernard Picart_

# About

The _benedictio thalami_, or the blessing of the bedchamber, is a prayer found in the Roman Ritual for the wedding bed.

# Benedictio thalami 

V. Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Domini. 

R. Qui fecit caelum et terram. 

V. Dominus vobiscum. 

R. Et cum spiritu tuo.

Oremus. Benedic, Domine thalamum nunc; ut omnes habitantes in eo, in tua pace consistant, et in tua voluntate permaneant, et senescant, et multiplicentur in longitudinem dierum, et ad regna caelorum perveniant. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.

# Blessing of the bridal chamber

P: Our help is in the name of the Lord.

All: Who made heaven and earth.

P: The Lord be with you.

All: May He also be with you.

Let us pray. Lord, bless this bridal chamber, that those who share it may abide in your peace and conform themselves to your will. And as they grow older may they know many happy years together, and come finally to your heavenly kingdom; through Christ our Lord. Amen.

(It is sprinkled with holy water.)
