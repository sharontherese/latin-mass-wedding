# About

Your wedding music choices will depend on the type of Mass you're having, and the resources available at your church.

In a low Mass, the Mass is not sung. You may have the option to have hymns in a few places during the Mass. 

In a high mass, the Mass is sung. You may have the option to choose the settings of some of the music (gregorian chant or polyphony), and as above, you may have the option to have some hymns.

Do bear in mind that your wedding day is not primarily a music concert. Try to choose music that complements, rather than overwhelms, the Mass and the singers you have.

# Choosing settings for the Propers

The Propers are the texts of the Mass specific to that Mass, such as the Introit, Alleluia, Offertory, and Communion.

The gregorian chant setting for the nuptial propers can be found in a few places online:

* Corpus Christi Watershed. http://www.ccwatershed.org/goupil/ (Scroll down to "Nuptial Mass")
* Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest. http://www.institute-christ-king.org/resources/sacred-music#votive (Scroll down to "Votive Masses")
* Windsor Tridentine Mass Community. http://www.windsorlatinmass.org/latin/chant.htm (Scroll down to "Nuptial Mass")

There are very few polyphonic settings of the nuptial propers. They are difficult to find, and may require a competent schola with plenty of rehearsal time. I am always on the hunt for polyphonic nuptial propers. See my findings to date [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NQwTRTvyMOBT_CMDE60Y52wk-QyPfnfaEH-C8vNq1HU/edit?usp=sharing). 

# Choosing settings for the Ordinary

The Ordinary of the Mass is any Mass text that is always the same, such as the Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei (the Credo is not included in the wedding Mass). There is an optional Preface for the wedding Mass as well.

This is where you may have the most freedom. There are many gregorian settings, and countless polyphonic settings. 

The gregorian settings can be found here: 

* Corpus Christi Watershed. http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/

Here are a few popular polyphonic settings:

* Mozart, "Missa brevis in G major"
* Rusca, Francesco Spagnoli. “Missa Brevis.”
* Haller, Michael. “Messe Secunda, Op. 5, No. 2.” 
* Victoria, Tomas Luis de. “Missa Dominicalis.” 
* Dalitz, Christoph. “Missa Tribus Vocibus.” 

# Choosing other sacred music

Below are a few popular choices for hymns, motets, and chants for the wedding Mass. Many of these texts have more than one setting. If you need inspiration, consider the background of you and your future spouse (French, Italian, Irish, etc.), or the feasts on/near your wedding day. If your wedding day is near, for example, St. Thomas Aquinas' feast day, you could choose one of the many songs he composed, or a song centered on the Eucharist, a common theme in St. Thomas' works.

* Nuptial Blessing: the Nuptial Blessing may be chanted. Read more [here](/nuptial-blessing/)
* Nuptial Preface: the Nuptial Preface may be chanted. Read more [here](post/preface/)  and see sheet music at [Gregobase](https://gregobase.selapa.net/chant.php?id=10469)
